# RMBench-2022


## Brief Intro

n this work, we present RMBench, the first benchmark for robotic manipulations, which have high-dimensional continuous action and state spaces. We implement and evaluate reinforcement learning algorithms that directly use observed pixels as inputs.

### RL algirithms
